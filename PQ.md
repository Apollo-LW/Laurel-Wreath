# Notes
- Each phase includes both the **Technical** side (UI, UX, Functionality, ..., etc) and the **Non-Technical** side (How things works, why the solve the problem, is there a way to improve later, ..., etc)
- **Everyone work on Everythings**, meaning that we're problem solver/software engineers, we aren't product owners or limited to some skill, time, or a space to improve.
- **Learning > x**; where x is every other thing that is not learning
- We can get back to phase, we can't get back in time tho, so make each sprint count
